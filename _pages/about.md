In my latest role, I have created machine learning models to find hidden insights and contribute to the company's bottom line through opportunity prediction, forecasting, segmentation and product recommendation models. Prior to that I have collaborated with internal customers to create and track key metrics and implement dashboards for the executive leadership.

Having worked closely with data in all my roles over the 10 years, finding ways to convert data into insight is second nature to me. I am extremely adept at self-learning and passionate about making the world a better place through predictive analytics.
