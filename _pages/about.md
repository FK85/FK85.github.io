I have had the opportunity to work closely with data in all my roles so far. In my latest role, I have created machine learning models to find hidden insights and contribute to the company's bottom line through opportunity prediction and product recommendation models. Prior to that I have collaborated with internal customers to create key metrics and implemented dashboards for the executive leadership. I have also worked as a consultant for Capgemini helping a leading credit card client overhaul their payment processing system.
